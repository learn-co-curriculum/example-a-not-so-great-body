Below is the main body of a Readme that explains the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Framework. 

**There are three parts to MVC; model, view, controller. The model manages the fundamental behaviours and data of the application. This could be retrieved from a database or any other sort of data store.**

**The view is the user interface. This takes data from the model and displays it nicely for the user. Any user interaction in the view is then handed over to the controller.**

**The controller receives user input and makes calls to the model and view to update/modify either. This keeps the main aspects of our application separate.**

### Why doesnâ€™t this work? 

We can assume that at this point in the curriculum, this material isn't overly technical for students. But it is pretty dry, not very engaging, and could be too abstract of a concept. Using a metaphor or a real-world analogy would help make it more clear. In the next lesson, let's see the reworked version.
